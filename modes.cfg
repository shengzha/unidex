## Mode configuration file.
## Fields and specification:
## 1) AssayName: name of assay, no spaces
## 2-4) Read specifications: Read1 Index1 Index2 Read2
##   Format for each component of the read is comma separated
##   Each component must have the component name, a colon, then the length
##   If the length is listed as '0' then it is the rest of the read
##   Special names:
##      'readN' indicates that the component will be an output sequence read, can specify any number for 'N', usually 1 and 2
##      'indexN' indicates that the component is an index, these indexes must have a corresponding index file listed in the last columns
##      'null' indicates bases to be excluded from output
##      Any other names will be treated as 'special' field and included in the output read name (e.g. UMIs)
## 5-N) File specification for each index. e.g. 'index1=[path to file]'
##    Can be any number of fields as long as each listed index is represented once.
##    For each index file, the format can be tab delimited and either: 'name number seq', 'name seq' or just a list of sequences.
##    In any case, the last column of the file MUST be the sequence that is expected in the read.
## 5-N) An additional class can be specified as 'flags=' with a defined set of possible flags.
##    One or more flags can be provided as a comma-separated list.
##    Defined flags:
##      [index]_hd:[value]  Specify a hamming distance for an index (override), e.g. 'index1_hd:1'
##      [index]_rc          Specify an index needs to be reverse compelement, e.g. 'index3_rc'
##      [index]_omit        Exclude printing this index in the concatenated index
##      [index]_name         Instead of printing the index sequence, use the name specified in the index file.
##                            Names MUST be the FIRST column of index file, with sequence as LAST column.
##      batch:[nreads]      Specify the output fastq files to be split into batches of certain number of reads
##                            this is for making large runs more manageable for later processing.
##                            e.g. 'batch:100000000' for fastq file outs of 100M reads.
##      ascii               Compress the combined sample/cell index using ascii triplets (deprecated)
##      original            Keep the original read name along with index read name
##      prefix:[text]       Include a prefix in the final output CellID. The field will be added on to
##                            the start of the cell barcode followed by a '_'. Do not include special
##                            characters or spaces and do not start with a number.
##      suffix:[text]       Same as prefix, but adds to the end after adding a '_'; can start with a number.
##      spacer:[str]        Adds a spacer between indexes (or names), [str] cannot be: ':' or '-', rec: '_'
##
## For custom mode files, all lines with "##" can be excluded, but the header line (below) is required.
